// File to contain definitions of different matrix types based on group theory
// Intention is to simplify function signatures of other functions that use these matrix groups
// Idea is to use traits to make constructing objects type-generic
//
// Comments are to lay out which ones to do
//
// SO3 matrix
// SE3 matrix
// Generic 3-vector
// v (angular velocity vector) - if needing special traits
// V (6-vector spatial velocity vec)
// ad matrix
