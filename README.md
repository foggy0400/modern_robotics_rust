# modern_robotics_rust
Rust implementation of the Modern Robotics library (WIP)

This project aims to create a Rust library implementation of the support code from Lynch and Park's Modern Robotics textbook.
The core motivation is to port the core functionality of the library to a compiled, type safe language compared to the original MATLAB implementation.

In the future, I aim to use the code in this library to create further robotic kinematic and dynamic simulation libraries, partially based on the research I conducted for my thesis.
